# James Anthony's Website

I'm not sure what I'm doing yet, but I like crediting people.

## Credits

- [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) - Thanks to its creators, contributors and maintainers.
- [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) - I started by forking this theme
- [SVG icons](https://github.com/neilorangepeel/Free-Social-Icons) - Used by Jekyll-Now and leaving this here as long as it's used
